# 1: Business Understanding & Problem Framing

How to quickly understand the business context

Background information on task 1

PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model. The client also wants to try a discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.

The Lead Data Scientist (LDS) held an initial team meeting to discuss various hypotheses, including churn due to price sensitivity. After discussion with your team, you have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities.

Your LDS wants an email with your thoughts on how the team should go about to test this hypothesis.

# Objectives:

Your first task today is to understand what is going on at the client and think about how you would approach a problem like this to test this specific hypothesis.

Formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email to your LDS, focusing on the potential data that you would need from the client and analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.

# We would suggest spending no more than one hour on this task.

Please note, there are multiple ways to approach the task and that the sample answer is just one way to do it.
